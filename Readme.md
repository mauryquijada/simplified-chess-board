# Simplied Chess Board

By Maury Quijada, created on November 2, 2012

This program implements the simplified chessboard as defined by the requirement
to:
    Create a short, commented program that displays a chess board and allows 
    user CLI interaction to update the positions as the board. 
    
Note that the requirements do not state that the move must follow any 
conventions of the game Chess, which makes this a _simplified_ chess board.
